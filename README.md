My Resume
======

Howdy recruiters!  Want to know what I've done and what I'm good at?  Well look no further, it's my resume in easily parsible JSON!!!!

If you would like to see a pretty rendering of it (and possibly do a PDF print of it to put into your HR system), feel free to install the [resume NPM package](https://jsonresume.org/)  via:

`sudo npm install -g resume`

...clone this repo...

`git clone https://github.com/skingry/resume.git`

...and then do a little bit of this:

`resume serve`

Et Voila!
